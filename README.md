# How to Markdown
In this repository you will find an example documentation that not only shows you how a good, well-structured documentation *could* look like - **while teaching you Markdown syntax!**

## How you can dive deeper into Markdown:
You can see Markdown in action by opening the documentation and clicking on "Code" to see the raw code of the Documentation. A great way to see how a Documentation is formatted under the hood!
