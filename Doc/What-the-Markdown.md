## Getting Started
Markdown is a simple and lightweight markup language that lets you format text so it's more structured and readable. It plays a big loe in our everyday lives - without us noticing. It also plays a huge part in the life of a **software engineer**! GitHub, GitLab, Obsidian, Jupyther notebooks and even Discord messages use or support Markdown to some capacity in their own ways. The most common form of Markdown is **standard Markdown**, which is fully supported by GitHub, GitLab and Obsidian, just to name a few. In this document, you will learn the *basics* of the **standard implementation of Markdown**.
## Basic text styles
In Markdown, there are quite a few different formats or *styles* your text can take on. Here are the **essential** formats that you likely will use the most, as those are **essential** to structuring your Documentation:

Headings:
```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```
The result:

Bold text:
```md
**bold text**
```
The result:

Italics:
```md
*italicized text*
```
The result:

## Lists
Lists are essential to organise bulletpointts, make rankings or make a table of content. In Markdown, there are two types of lists: Ordered and unordered lists.
